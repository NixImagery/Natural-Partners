<strong>Investigating Sustainable Forestry with Lego Mindstorm Robots</strong>

This unit of work shows the benefits and principles of sustainable reforestation through situational outdoor learning which is reinforced by a robotic simulation. It aims to provide an engaging and meaningful engineering project to S3 learners. It has been built around the Third and Fourth Levels of Curriculum for Excellence to create a STEM orientated unit for Broad General Education. The unit draws on influences from Design Technology, Science and Maths resulting in a fully integrated interdisciplinary project.
