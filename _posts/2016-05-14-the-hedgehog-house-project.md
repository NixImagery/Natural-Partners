The hedgehog population is in dramatic decline: numbers have declined by over a third between 2003 and 2012 through loss of habitats (fragmentation) and poor management of hedgerows. In this interdisciplinary project, learners will learn about the natural environment for a hedgehog and the importance of protecting the hedgehog species, and will design and manufacture a hedgehog house.
