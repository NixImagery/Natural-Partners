This unit of work is designed to provide pupils with information on where their food comes from and how we can produce food for a sustainable future. Pupils will undertake a wide variety of activities to enhance their understanding of the topic and to develop valuable life skills. The topic will use active learning though discussion and outdoor learning to enable the pupils to develop a deeper and more personal understanding of the unit.

Pupils will also use enquiry skills to evaluate their own diets to lead them towards healthier life choices. Pupils will look at the local community and how the surrounding area has in the past provided sustainable food sources as well as how it can do this in the future. In this unit questioning will be used to guide and support topical discussions such as a debate on GM crops. Through this pupils will develop a wide range of skills relating to literacy, health and wellbeing and science. The topic will be linked to information that has been previously covered by other subject areas as well as topics yet to be covered in other subjects to provide an interdisciplinary experience for the pupils.
