In this unit we will be looking back at the history of Scottish forests, looking first at the ways in which the trees first populated Scotland after the last ice age. From there we will look at events which have impacted upon forest populations before looking at how the forests of today are used now. Pupils will be encouraged to research topics of interest. The main focus of this unit will be climate change and how this will effect our forests. This unit will also deal with a theoretical situation in which the ice has melted from the polar ice caps and places such as Greenland.
