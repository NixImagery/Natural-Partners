This presentation proposes a unit of work which introduces learners to the problem of plastics and their environmental impact, and then goes on to examine the manufacture of alternatives. Learners will make their own plastic item (e.g. a spoon) from potato starch or milk within an enquiry and design framework which develops skills and attitudes to real-world problem solving in a scientific and technological context.

Aims of the unit are:

1. Identify and analyse material properties

2. Analyse the environmental impact of materials and products on the environment

3. Investigate how products can be made more sustainable

The presentation includes links to further resources.
