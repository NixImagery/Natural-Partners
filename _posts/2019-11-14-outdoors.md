This poster proposes a range of lessons related to the outdoors and the relationship that we as humans have with it. Several examples of the lessons are based outdoors, giving inspiration and rich stimulus beyond the usual constraints of a classroom. There is a clear linkage to geography and mathematics through mapping. Three principal areas organise the lessons:

* Appreciating the outdoors
* Effects of humans on the environment
* Camping equipment design and adapting to the environment
