In 2018, 55 % of the world’s population lived in urban areas, and that figure is set to rise to 68 % by 2050,according to the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs. The world now has 33 megacities, cities with a population greater than 10 million residents, and this number is set to rise to 48 by 2050. Many of these cities are leading centres of commerce and politics in the emerging economies of the global south, and preparing young people to understand the world they live in involves understanding this new kind of urban environment.

In this unit, pupils will learn about the factors driving the growth of megacities, as well as finding ways to envisage life in a megacity through statistics. They will explore one of the major issues of life in large cities by carrying our an investigation into air pollution, and will engage with the work of designing these environments by exploring skyscrapers. Finally, they will examine the technological and legislative drive towards more sustainable urban living.
