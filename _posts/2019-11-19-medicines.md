The current structure of the NHS, global pharmaceutical economy and provision of free prescriptions in Scotland is unsustainable.

Medications are produced across the globe, with huge numbers of vital medications being imported from Europe and the USA. Economic instability due to Brexit has already shown decline in availability of some medications with this number is expected to grow.

Furthermore leaflets, packaging and bottles contribute millions of tonnes of waste to landfill annually. Blister packs are a particular problem as they are currently non-recyclable.

During this unit of work, pupils will examine the impact of the global healthcare industry on the natural environment, explore the
manufacturing processes of pharmaceuticals and design more eco-friendly, sustainable packaging.
